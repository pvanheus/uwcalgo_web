UWC Algorithms Circle
=====================

### [](#welcome-to-uwc-algorithm-circlebeta)Welcome to UWC Algorithm Circle(beta).

The UWC Algorithm Circles is a a space for students to sharpen their
problem solving and analytical skills. We meet in the Computer Science
Netlab at 1pm on Wednesdays. Problems are posted on this page and
solutions for previous problems are saved on
[GitHub](https://github.com/uwcalgo/sessions).

For the session on 13 May 2015 we've chosen 3 problems:

1.  *String encryption:* Letter substitution ciphers work by mapping
    each letter of the alphabet to another letter in some predictable
    way. A simple example is the
    [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)*Caesar cipher* where
    a fixed offset is used to choose the substitution letter. For
    example the offset 13 turns **a** into **n**, **b** into **o**, and
    so on. The cipher wraps around the alphabet, so for example **n**
    becomes **a**. A more sophisticated cipher is the *[Vigenère
    cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)* where
    the key is a sequence of offsets, normally represented as a word.
    For example **baa** stands for the offsets **2 1 1**. These are then
    repeated until the entire text is encrypted. The challenge here is
    to implement functions to encrypt and decrypt with the Vigenère
    cipher. Non-letter characters (e.g. whitespace and punctuation)
    should be ignored. For example, given the key **fribbit** and the
    text **the zombies are coming**, you should get the encrypted text
    (ciphertext) **yym apuunva bsm vtdqoh**.
2.  *The Marching Band problem:* Rated medium, this is problem 3 from
    the [2013 Standard Bank IT Challenge
    heats](http://www.olympiad.org.za/olympiad/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SBITC-Heats-Problems-v-13-04-14-Final.pdf).
3.  *The Robot Crowd Control problem:*Rated hard, this is problem 2 from
    the [SBITC 2014 problem
    set](http://www.olympiad.org.za/olympiad/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-SBITC-Complete-problem-set.pdf).

Don't forget, GitHub and reddit are there to help discuss and share
solutions for the problems.

If you are new to Github and do not know how to submit your algorithm,
take a few minutes to read this guide:

### [](#misc)History and Future

The Algorithms circle was started by Warren, Peter and Shev and they
currently provide the problems to challenge the circle. We welcome new
suggestions of problems to tackle, especially ones drawn from real world
needs.

    I am not a man of codes.
    But I respect the power of codes, for that is what transformed me.
    The codes of the Turing.
    Others had heard them, contemplated them, and so on.
    But I understood them, and they changed me.
    For what was I before I understood those codes?
    Nothing.
